<li>Dataset used is the one described in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03827" >Face2Text: Collecting an Annotated Image Description Corpus for the
5
Generation of Rich Face Descriptions</a> </li>
6
<li>It was made available to us on request. </li>
7
<li>The dataset consists of the around 5685 annotated images chosen randomly from CelebA dataset.</li>
8
<li>The annotations describe the images as naturally as possible and focus on capturing the person's facial expression and/or their emotional state.</li>
9
<li>We seem to be the first to work on this dataset for task of face description. </li></ul>

# Future Improvements
28
​
29
<ul><li>Use a pretrained network trained for face recognition task to get image encodings. This can help identify the nuances in facial features and give better performance</li>
30
<li>Fine tune beam search</li>
31
<li>Perform hyperparameter tuning</li>
